How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    fez eu ver como pode economizar tempo e que eu nunca havia feito isso

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    because writing isn[t a linear process there are step fowards and bakwards 
    and it will be necessary to look over something

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I believe the pro is that you have more personalised controll over the 
    changes you are carring out and donpt create unnecessary versions and 
    spare valuable space. The con is you might loose a good chances to commit 
    as its up for the user to think about that

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    so you don't loose track of all your documents since they are interdependent

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    so the git log brings the list o commits made and the git diff compare the
    differences between them. Too cool for school!

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because i know that i will be able to get back to where i was before without
     a trauma

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
